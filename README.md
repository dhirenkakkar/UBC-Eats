	Backend pythong script scrapes one year's worth of food spending data from the university student portal. This is performed using Selenium to perform automated button clicks and beutiful soup to make HTTP request and write the parsed response onto a CSV file.

	Generates descriptive statistics such as average spending per day, locations spent, per account, etc. 

	Generates time series data (spending over time) and a heatmap using python tools Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas.

* Frontend 

	Integrated such that sign in button calls the python script and then outputs the returned HTML data onto the next window.
